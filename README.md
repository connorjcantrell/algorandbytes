# Algorand Bytes

## Welcome
We are a community of Algorand Developers who balances self learning with peer-to-peer learning. We make a few freinds along the way too.

## How it works
Complete our collection of challenges at your own pace. Challenges increase in difficulty and are designed to be completed on a weekly basis. Every Saturday at 1:00PM EST, meet virtually to discuss the solution with others.

Visit our list of [challenges] and we'll see you next Saturday!
