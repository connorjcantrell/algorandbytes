# Algorand Bytes

## Welcome
We are a community of Algorand Developers who balance self-learning with a weekly virtual catchup to discuss solutions.

## How it works
Complete our collection of challenges at your own pace. Challenges increase in difficulty and are designed to be completed on a weekly basis. Every Saturday at 1:00PM EST, meet virtually to discuss the solution with others.

Visit our list of [challenges](https://github.com/connorjcantrell/algorandbytes/challenges) and we'll see you next Saturday!
